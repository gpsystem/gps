# Creation

Now that you've scaffolded your project out, it's time to start writing code!

Currently, we don't have the infrastructure to support testing plugins in the GPS ecosystem. For right now, you will need to just write the code on our own, with no supporting infrastructure. You can bundle your code into `dist/index.js` by using `npm run build` anywhere in your project, and paste the code into a GeoFS devtools console.

A migration guide will be posted once infrastructure to test plugins in the GPS ecosystem is ready.
