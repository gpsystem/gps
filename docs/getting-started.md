# Getting started

GeoFS Plugin System is a marketplace for plugins. Plugins are scripts that a developer creates and lists, so they can be used by users. Anyone can choose what plugins they want to use in the main extension, which is a chrome extension.

## Installation

Right now, the main extension is still in development. More details will be published in the future, along with installation instructions.
